       <h2>An Introduction</h2>
           <p class="intro">Hello, I am Robert king, and welcome to my introduction page.  I currently live in Morgantown, West Virginia.  Morgantown is a town with a population of 29,316, located in Monongalia County along the Monongahela River, and is considered one of the best places to live in West Virginia.  Morgantown is home to West Virginia University, which includes an art museum, a sculpture garden, and the WVU Core Arboretum, which has an old-growth forest and spring wildflowers.</p>
           <p>I am attending Bellevue University through the Veteran Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation program.  This is due to several service-connected disabilities that I received while serving in the United States Army from 2000 to 2004.  While serving in the Army as a paratrooper, I was deployed to Afghanistan as a Tactical Satellite Communications Operator with the 35Th Signal Brigade in support of the 101St and 82nd Airborne units, along with support for other governmental agencies.</p>
           <p><span class="sentence">I am taking my fourth semester at Bellevue University and pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Web Development with a minor in Computer Information Systems.</span>  I am attempting to complete my program in two and a half years total, and after this semester, I will have obtained 64 of the 127 credits needed to complete the program.  I currently have been able to maintain a 4.0 average and enjoy learning each new subject that I am introduced to.  Upon completion of the program at Bellevue University, I will be the first member of my family to have received a college degree.</p>
           <p>As for things I like to do in my free time, which is currently limited due to taking five classes this semester, I usually gravitate toward intellectual and nerdy hobbies.  Outside of the classroom, I enjoy studying several programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and JavaScript.   I also enjoy games like Magic the Gathering and role-playing games such as Fallout, No Manâ€™s Sky, Elite Dangerous, and Skyrim.  In the rare moments I can find extra time during the evenings, I enjoy setting up my Meade 10-inch telescope and continuing to learn about astrophotography.</p>
